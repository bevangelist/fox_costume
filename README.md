Handmade fox costumes for your mobile devices
---------------------------------------------

This repository contains instructions and guides for handmade (crochet)
fox costumes for mobile devices.


About
-----

The project started after the first model, developed by me for a ***Keon***
[Geeksphone](http://www.geeksphone.com/) phone at
[Campus Party](http://campusparty.com.br/) was born
(see CHANGELOG for the full history)
and I decided to share the concept and instructions with the world.

[Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/)
(by [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org)) and the orange developer phone
(by [Geeksphone](http://www.geeksphone.com/))
was my inspirations for creating this mobile phone case-costume. So I figured
that it would be a shame to not release the instructions in anything less than
an open source manner as well.

This phone case celebrates the open web, the hacking culture of DIY makers and
the freedom of the crochet crafters (a crochet hook is a powerful 3D printer).
